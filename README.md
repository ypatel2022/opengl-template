# OpenGL Template

Welcome to the OpenGL Template!

This C++ template code is designed for Visual Studio 2022 and includes OpenGL, GLFW, glm, and Dear ImGUI, making it easy to get started with your OpenGL projects.

## Why Use This Template?

Are you tired of dealing with the tedious setup required for an OpenGL project? I understand your pain, and that's why I decided to create this template! It takes care of the initial setup, so you can focus on the fun partâ€”building your OpenGL applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get started with the template:

1. Click on the "Use as Template" button or clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Once the template is on your machine, double click on the `opengl-template.sln` file to open the project in Visual Studio.

3. After opening the project, ensure that you change the architecture to x86 (Win32) in Visual Studioâ€”this is required or else your project won't compile.

4. You're all set to unleash your creativity and develop your OpenGL project! ðŸš€

I hope this template streamlines your development process and makes working with OpenGL a breeze. Happy coding! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to leave a pull request or a new issue. Enjoy your OpenGL journey! ðŸ˜Š
